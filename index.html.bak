    <h2>About Niklaus</h2>
	<p>Nicklaus Emil Wirth is a Swiss computer scientist who was born February 15th, 1934 
	   in Winterthur, Switzerland. He earned his bachelor's degree in Electronics 
	   Engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, his Master's
	   degree in from the University of Laval in Quebec City, and completed his doctorate
	   at the University of California Berkley. He received the A.M Turing Award in 1984
	   for developing multiple innovative computer design languages; this award is the 
	   highest honor one can receive in the field of computer science. Wirth held a 
	   professorship position at Stanford University from 1963-1967 and was instrumental 
	   in the creation of Stanford's computer science department. He returned to Zurich 
	   after his time at Stanford to finish his career at his alma mater, the Swiss 
	   Federal Institute of Technology. 
	<p>The programming languages Wirth developed are Euler, Algol W, Pascal, Modula, 
	   Modula-2, Oberon, Oberon-2, Oberon-07. Pascal is the most famous of these 
	   languages Wirth developed which named after the French mathematician, Blaise
	   Pascal. All of his languages emphasized legible code structuring to ensure 
	   that the code is viable to be reused in the future easily. This practice
	   made programming more efficient, and that was the lasting impact of the 
	   languages he developed.</p>
